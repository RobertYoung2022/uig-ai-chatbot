Great—now that you have one combined Markdown file, you can move forward with the ingestion process to create your prototype. Here’s a streamlined plan:

⸻

1. Ingest and Chunk Your Markdown File

Since your content is in a single Markdown file, you can load it and break it into smaller, manageable chunks (around 500 words each). This helps the chatbot retrieve the most relevant parts of your content when answering questions.

Example Code:

from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load your combined Markdown file
loader = UnstructuredMarkdownLoader("path/to/your/combined_file.md")
docs = loader.load()

# Split the document into 500-word chunks with some overlap (e.g., 50 words)
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

print(f"Total chunks created: {len(chunks)}")

2. Create Embeddings and Store in a Vector Store

Next, convert each chunk into an embedding. These embeddings will be stored in a vector database (like ChromaDB), which allows you to quickly retrieve the most relevant pieces of content based on a user query.

Example Code:

from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

# Create embeddings for the text chunks
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()  # You could also explore HuggingFace embeddings if needed

# Store embeddings in ChromaDB (persisting them in a local directory)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embeddings, persist_directory="./db")
vectorstore.persist()

print("Embeddings created and stored in vector database.")

3. Build a Chatbot Interface

Now that you have your vector store, you can set up a simple chatbot interface. A common and quick approach is to use Streamlit for the UI, where the chatbot will:
	1.	Take a user query.
	2.	Retrieve the most relevant chunks from your vector store.
	3.	Feed these chunks into an LLM (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) to generate an answer.

Example Code (Streamlit App):

import streamlit as st
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

st.title("DeFi Coach Chatbot")

query = st.text_input("Ask your DeFi question:")

if query:
    # Load the vector store with the persisted embeddings
    vectordb = Chroma(persist_directory="./db", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings())
    retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()

    # Build the retrieval augmented QA chain
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm=OpenAI(temperature=0.3),  # Adjust temperature for desired creativity
        retriever=retriever
    )

    # Run the query through the chain
    answer = qa_chain.run(query)
    st.write(answer)

Run this app by executing:

streamlit run app.py

4. Test and Iterate
	•	Test the Prototype: Ask different DeFi or crypto-related questions to see how well the chatbot responds using your company’s content.
	•	Iterate: Based on your tests, you might tweak the chunk size, overlap, or even adjust the LLM parameters to better capture the tone and specificity of your content.
	•	Feedback Loop: Use the insights from the chatbot’s responses to refine the content ingestion process, add metadata, or even suggest additional content topics for your team.

This process gives you a low-cost, quickly deployable prototype that leverages your existing content while allowing for easy scaling and updates as new material comes in.
